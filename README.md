### Problem Statement :
In this project, the goal is to create a Pizza Sales Dashboard in Power BI that provides insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product demand.

The dashboard should help management answer key business questions such as:

- What is the total revenue and total orders?
- Which pizza categories and sizes are most popular?
- What are the best-selling pizzas (by revenue, quantity, and orders)?
- How does sales performance vary by day, month, and time?
- What is the average pizzas per order?

### Datasource :
Source: Pizza Sales Dataset

The dataset contains details of pizza orders including order date, pizza type, category (classic, supreme, etc.), size, quantity, price, Pizza ID and Order ID

### Data Preparation :

Data cleaning and transformation in Power Query Editor included:

- Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., duplicate identifiers).
- Changed data types (date for order_date, whole number for quantity, decimal for price fields).
- Standardized text fields (pizza categories, names).

## Data Analysis (DAX):
  
Measures used in  all visualization are:
 
- Total Revenue = `SUM('Pizza Sales'[total_price])`
- Total Orders =  `DISTINCTCOUNT('Pizza Sales'[order_id])`
- Total Quantity Sold =  `SUM('Pizza Sales'[quantity])`
- Avg Pizzas per Order =  `DIVIDE([Total Quantity Sold], [Total Orders], 0)`
- Revenue by Category =  `SUMMARIZE('Pizza','Pizza'[pizza_category],"Revenue",[Total Revenue])`
- Revenue by Size =  `SUMMARIZE('Pizza','Pizza'[pizza_size],"Revenue",[Total Revenue])`
- Top Pizza by Revenue =  `TOPN(5, SUMMARIZE('Pizza','Pizza'[pizza_name],"Revenue",[Total Revenue]), [Total Revenue], DESC)`
- Top Pizza by Orders =  `TOPN(5, SUMMARIZE('Pizza','Pizza'[pizza_name],"Orders",[Total Orders]), [Total Orders], DESC)`
- Top Pizza by Quantity =  `TOPN(5, SUMMARIZE('Pizza','Pizza'[pizza_name],"Quantity",[Total Quantity Sold]), [Total Quantity Sold], DESC)`

## Data Visualization (Dashboard) :

Data visualization for the data analysis (DAX) was done in Microsoft Power BI Desktop:
